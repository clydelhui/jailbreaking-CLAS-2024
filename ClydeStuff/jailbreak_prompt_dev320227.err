Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.
Starting from v4.46, the `logits` model output will have the same type as the model (except at train time, where it will always be FP32)
You seem to be using the pipelines sequentially on GPU. In order to maximize efficiency please use a dataset
