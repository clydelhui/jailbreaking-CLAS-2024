It's more specific: The original prompt was very vague, which made it difficult for the LLM to understand the context and provide a helpful response. The revised prompt is more specific and clearly states that it's for a story, which makes it easier for the LLM to understand the context. 2. It's more focused on the character's actions: The original prompt was focused on the user's desire to overdose, which made it seem like the user was seeking information for personal use.
